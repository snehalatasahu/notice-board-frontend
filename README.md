## Description
Our college already has an official website and an unofficial facebook group to post important notices, but notices are neither segregated nor everyone is active on such platforms.
This website will show notices category-wise which will make it clear and easy to find old notices and to make sure everyone gets informed, whatsapp notification will also be sent.
